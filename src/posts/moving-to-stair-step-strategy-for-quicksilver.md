Around the time that Vivian was born last fall, I spent a lot of time reading and learning about marketing, sales, and getting a new business off the ground. I found things that I felt like I should have known a long time ago.

I've decided to use [Rob Walling's Stair Step Approach](https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/) instead of focusing on SaaS. So, I launched a [new site](https://www.quicksilvercre.com), focused on one-off sales of [Excel templates](https://www.quicksilvercre.com/excel).

My strategy for Quicksilver did include exporting to Excel and PDF for a single price, not as part of a monthly subscription. But it wasn't the focus. The focus was on developers analyzing multiple deals per month, looking for a fast way to do that without fighting both Excel and Powerpoint.

Now, I am planning to grow into that over the next couple years, while I get my [masters at Malm√∂](https://mau.se/en/study-education/programme/TAICS). My goal is to produce one or two new templates per month along with one or two blog posts. My tendency is to ignore the marketing and writing part, which is not productive.

Let me know if you have any tips on writing more!
