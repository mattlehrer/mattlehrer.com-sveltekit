A list of foods I have cravings for from cities I used to live in.

## Burgers

- Emmy Squared in Williamsburg, Brooklyn
- Lure Burger from Lure Fishbar in SoHo, Manhattan, which I discovered because of [this review](https://ny.eater.com/2006/9/14/6822667/on-the-house-the-best-burger-downtown)
- The Mushroom burger from Uneeda Burger in Seattle

## Other

- Bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel from David's Bagels in the East Village, Manhattan
- Kimchi Rice (and basically anything) from Bopbox in Seattle
- Eggplant wrap from Yalla in Seattle
- The breakfast burrito from Downtown Bakery in the East Village, Manhattan

I think there will be more.
